ConferenceXP
============

ConferenceXP is an open source video conferencing and collaboration platform.  

We are currently in the process of transitioning the codebase here from the old SVN repo.  
Please bear with us while we smooth out the rough edges.

To build ConferenceXP you'll need Visual Studio 2010.  

1. Clone the project
2. Run the VS 2010 Command prompt
3. cd to the root of the local project directory
4. Issue the command 'cxpbuild.bat release'
